# FizzBuzz Generator

FizzBuzz is typically a game played by children in order to strengthen their skills with times tables. It is also a common coding challenge given to prospective employees in order to test their ability to code, not necessarily how well they can code, but if they can code at all. The FizzBuzz test is a pass/fail test, with For Loops and if statements being at it's core. These are programming statements that should be learnt very early on.

I've taken the FizzBuzz test one step further by taking inputs from the end user to define the values for Fizz and Buzz along with how high they want the computer to count.
